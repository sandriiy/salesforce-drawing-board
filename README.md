# Salesforce Experience Cloud: Real-Time Drawing Board

A Lightning Web Component hosted on Experience Cloud subscribes to Platform Events and allows both authenticated and guest users to receive and publish events. It enables real-time drawing functionality, where every circle, shape, or line is instantly visible to all active users.

## Analytics

At its peak, the Experience Cloud site successfully supported 16 active guest users drawing in real time. No critical issues were encountered â€” only opportunities for optimization.

In just 3 hours, we managed to hit Salesforceâ€™s Sandbox limit of 10,000 delivered Platform Events. Huge thanks to everyone who participated! Sometimes, the unreal becomes real â€” all it takes is a bit of effort and one sleepless night.

A detailed technical analysis is available in the links below.
